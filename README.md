# Rush-MERN
One week project with MERN Stack

For this project we had to re-code a Twitter application feature.
Two person project. We had the obligation to use Stack Mern to implement the main features : account creation and connection,
post 140 sign posts, delete ou edit them, see other users posts, like them, follow a user and see his publication or ban a user
forbid him to follow your publication. Tag functionnalities to add #key word and find any other post with that keyword.

We used React but not Redux.
